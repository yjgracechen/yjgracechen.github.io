	<h1>Hi there, I'm Yongjie Chen!</h1>
	<p> As a Interaction Designer / UX Architect (background in Human Computer Interaction), I have expertise in applying core usability and accessibility principles to a broad range of complex and diverse business scenarios. I have in-depth User-Centred Design experience in mobile, tablet and web application design. I am highly creative with an eye for innovation and detail, yet still maintain a consistent scientific outlook and methodical approach. I have strong communication skills, and collaborate well within a team in an agile development environment, particularly with software developers due to my previous technical background. I am passionate about UX, and know how to present compelling UCD project cases to a diverse range of audiences.
	I am very enthusiastic about UX work and want to create something great that can make a different to people who use the product. I have the ability to work hard and respond resiliently to failure and adversity, and the inner quality that enables me to work hard and stick to my long-term passions and goals.
