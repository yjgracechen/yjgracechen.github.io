            <p> As a Interaction Designer / UX Architect (background in Human Computer Interaction), I am very enthusiastic about UX work and want to create something great that can make a different to people. 
            </p> 
           <img src="images/Yongjie.jpg" class="textwrap">
            <p> I studied and worked in UK for around 4 years already, and I am from China. 
                I have expertise in applying core usability and accessibility principles to a broad range of complex and diverse business scenarios. 
            I have in-depth User-Centred Design experience in mobile, tablet and web application design. 
            I am highly creative with an eye for innovation and detail, yet still maintain a consistent scientific outlook and methodical approach. 
            I have strong communication skills, and collaborate well within a team in an agile development environment, particularly with software developers due to my previous technical background. 
            I know how to present compelling UCD project cases to a diverse range of audiences.
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, I have the ability to work hard and respond resiliently to failure and adversity, and the inner quality that enables me to work hard and stick to my long-term passions and goals. 
            </p>
           <p>She has a MSc in Human-Centred Interactive Technologies and two bachelor degrees: BSc (Hons) in IT and BSc E-commerce.
