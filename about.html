	<h1>About</h1>
	<p> As a UX Architect (background in Human Computer Interaction), I am very enthusiastic about UX design work and want to create great user experience to improve people's daily life. 
	</p>
	<p> I have expertise in applying core usability and accessibility principles to a broad range of complex and diverse business scenarios. 
	I have in-depth User-Centred Design experience in mobile, tablet and web application design. 
	I am highly creative with an eye for innovation and detail, yet still maintain a consistent scientific outlook and methodical approach. 
	I know how to present compelling UCD project cases to a diverse range of audiences.
	</p>
	<p> I have strong communication skills, and collaborate well within a team in an agile development environment, particularly with software developers due to my previous technical background. 
I have the ability to work hard and respond resiliently to failure and adversity, and the inner quality that enables me to work hard and stick to my long-term passions and goals.
